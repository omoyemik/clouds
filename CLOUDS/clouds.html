                        <p> I was born in Lagos, Nigeria. I am from the Yoruba Tribe. I studied Computer Science, Information Systems in Babcock University Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State. After school, I worked with a loan application firm. I approved loans on the website and helped gather information on customers that were defaulting. After that I worked in an e-commerce firm based in the US. I was in charge of the Nigerian office set up, allocating resources and liason between the nigerian and the american offices. After two years I moved to Spectra industries Limited where I helped set up their IT Infrastructure. I have experience in C++ and Java languages. I am learning so I can be better with them. I am learning about cloud technologies and mobile app development. My interests are mostly in pop-culture and Nigerian music. I have seen how Nigerian music is getting some recognition but I am also trying to see how tech plays into it. And how new technologies can make things better for Nigerian artistes. I am passionate about causes related to women. In my free time  I like to create cool things from Resin art.
